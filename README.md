Working with this file:
1. Clone the repository
2. Update "data.txt" -> fill in user and pwd
3. From clinical_trials.py update the global variable download_path
4. run clinical_trials.py

Note:
- clinical_trials.py -> main file
- postgres_operations.py -> postgres operations (start connection, construct relation, cursor, etc)
- keys.py -> recursive helper function to find list of keys in parsed XML
